## Looking for Clubs
One of the problems that I ran into when I first came to UH Manoa was that I couldn't find many clubs that interested me. I couldn't find a complete list of all the clubs I could join. Only the RIOs were documented in an accessible place and all other information about other clubs came from ACM members coming to class to present their available clubs. A simple solution for this would be a website that documents all the clubs that are currently available in UH Manoa.

## Features
The website would feature a page that contains all the clubs available. The page further contains categories of clubs that would narrow down the search, to make it easier for students to find clubs that are more in line with their interests. Once students log in, they can also select clubs they are interested in, which will show up in a seperate page for their viewing. Students and staff can also submit new clubs that they have created, which will have to undergo approval from an admin to show up on the application.

In total, the website will contain at least 4 pages once the user is logged in:
- A general club listing page that contains all the clubs available at UH Manoa
- A page that lists all the clubs the user is interested in
- A page that lists all the clubs the user is currently in
- A page that creates clubs
- For admins, an extra page will also be included, showing all the newly created clubs waiting for approval
The club listing page does not require the user to be logged in to view.

The club listing page contains categories that clubs are attributed to, that can be selected for easier search. Categories include deparments and RIOs.
