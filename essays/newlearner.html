  <p>When I realized that we would be focusing on JavaScript for ICS 314, I had high hopes. My prior experience with JavaScript was limited since I never had the time to learn it myself. C, C++, and Java were the programming languages that I learned in a classroom setting. HTML &amp; CSS I did acquire on my own, but that was during my high school days when I had more time on my hands outside of class. Thus, I was excited to be able to spend class time learning one of the most popular programming languages.</p>

<p>After working through the Basic JavaScript and ES6 courses on FreeCodeCamp, my first thought was that JavaScript is incredibly loose. The flexibility with variables and functions was surprising to me; I was used to declaring variable types and jumping through hoops to change from one datatype to another. None of that exists in JavaScript!</p>

<p>Functions as first-class were also initially baffling to me. It’s not a feature any of the previous languages I’d learned has. I quickly realized how useful it was as well since it allows functions to chain together efficiently. I immediately started to brainstorm how I could use this feature in a small side project of mine that involved JavaScript.</p>

<p>Oh, would you look at the time? The deadline for a practice Workout Of the Day for ICS 314 has passed. Writing from Week 2 of ICS 314, I’ll be honest, I’m not a fan of the stress that comes with athletic software engineering. However, I do think it is an effective way to keep up a steady workflow for this class, although clearly I am not used to it yet this early on in the semester. I shall mourn my loss and work on the other two experiences due this week.</p>

<p>But back to JavaScript (don’t worry, this essay is one of the said experiences due this week). From what I have learned thus far, JavaScript is a very intuitive programming language. I am most excited to learn how to use it in tandem with HTML &amp; CSS for web design. The experience that jumpstarted my interest in programming was blog platforms that allowed you to customize the source code of your blog. While complete customization is certainly doable with just HTML &amp; CSS, I’ve realized that JavaScript is needed for that extra flair and responsiveness.</p>

<p>Despite my limited knowledge as of now, I think JavaScript is a very useful programming language. Evidently, everyone else does as well! It is one of the most popular. Its interactiveness with HTML &amp; CSS is what gives it to me though. Overall, by learning JavaScript and practicing athletic software engineering, I think this will be a challenging but fun and interesting semester.</p>
